SCALE FOR PROJECT A-MAZE-ING
Standard usage
Display
Run the a_maze_ing.py script, using a default configuration file. You should get a maze randomly generated, displayed on the terminal or using a dedicated graphic window, and a way to interact with the program.

Interactive menu
Among the possible interactions, control that the mandatory ones are present:

Re-generate a new maze.

A toggle button to show and hide the shortcut path from entry to exit.

A button to change the colours of the walls.

Extra interactions are possible (e.g., changing the colour of the '42' pattern, quitting the program, ...)

Configuration file
Format
Control that the configuration files follow the requirements:

Comments lines start with '#'.

Each line is in the 'KEY=VALUE' format (lower case is also OK).

The expected keys are present (WIDTH, HEIGHT, ENTRY, EXIT, OUTPUT_FILE, PERFECT).

Error Management
Edit the configuration file to ensure that the program correctly handles its errors:

Remove a mandatory key.

Add a line that does not respect the 'KEY=VALUE' format (e.g., without the '=' sign).

Replace numbers by letters.

Use an incorrect boolean parameter for 'PERFECT'.

Use a wrong format of an input file for 'ENTRY' or 'EXIT'.

Reminder: in case of unexpected end of the program, the evaluation stops and final grade is 0.

Output file
Format
Run the a_maze_ing.py script and verify that the first generated (and displayed) maze is also stored in the defined output file. You should find:

'HEIGHT' lines of 'WIDTH' chars each, an empty line, the 'ENTRY' tuple, the 'EXIT' tuple, the shortest path from entry to exit described using directions 'N', 'E', 'S', 'W'.

Use the validation script provided with the subject to control the walls coherence.

Control that the shortest path sequence in the output file matches its visual representation.

Any error will mark this question as failed.

Maze Generator module
Maze generation
The maze generator module follows the subject's expectations:

A randomly generated maze, eventually using a suitable standard module of Python (e.g., the module 'random').

Adopt a relevant behaviour in case some parameters may be inconsistent (e.g., the entry or exit cells are outside the maze, width or height is negative, ...).

All cells can be reached, except, eventually, those creating the '42' pattern.

Have walls all around the maze.

There is no 3x3 or larger open zone without walls. Ask how this was implemented or verified in the code.

There is the '42' pattern in the maze (except if size does not allow it, then you should have a message on the terminal).

A perfect maze if the 'PERFECT' key in the configuration file is set to True.

The same maze is reproducible when using an identical seed (update the configuration file or the code to verify).

Are all these expectations fulfilled?

Reusable module
Have the evaluated solution/team re-generate the package, most preferably in a virtual environment or similar.
This must re-create the maze .jar or .whl file. Then, in a different virtual environment or similar, install the newly created package, and test it with the a_maze_ing.py script and its configuration file. Is everything working properly?

Bonuses
Note: The PDF also contains numerical sequences on pages 1 and 3 which appear to be formatting artifacts or image coordinates rather than readable text content.
